From its humble beginnings with short, silent films, anime has evolved into a global phenomenon, captivating audiences with its diverse genres, intricate plots, and artistic brilliance. Notable milestones in anime history include the release of classics like "Astro Boy" in the 1960s, the rise of Studio Ghibli with timeless masterpieces such as "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Spirited Away," and the explosive popularity of series like "Naruto," "Attack on Titan," and "My Hero Academia."
